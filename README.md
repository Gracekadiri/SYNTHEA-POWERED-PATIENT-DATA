# SYNTHEA-POWERED-PATIENT-DATA
# Introduction:
Synthea is an open-source patient simulator that generates synthetic medical records of realistic patients. These records can be used for various purposes, such as training machine learning models or conducting research on healthcare trends. In this project, we will be analyzing Synthea-powered patient data to gain insights into the demographic and health-related characteristics of the patients.
# Aim:
The aim of this project is to analyze the Synthea-generated patient data and provide insights into the demographic and health-related characteristics of the patients. The analysis will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and making recommendations based on the findings.
